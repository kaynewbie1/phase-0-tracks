<!-- Reflection Notes:
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
  Desicribes the content in detail to the browser and provides a reference point for me as the developer
Which ones do you see as most useful?
  I think they are all very useful in describing the content, but I like <nav> and <footer>
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  I believe The browser reads from top to bottom, something I need clarification on.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
  that it is flexible and very user friendly and allows us to create shortcuts for frequently used tags called snippets.
Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  Definately as I begin to design webpages. Very helpful.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
  Understanding how and if the various semantic elements should and/or can be nested.  Could use a little more help in understanding that.
How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  Research, attend office hours, test the elements live on a mock html page?? But would be easier if you told me (just being honest :-)
