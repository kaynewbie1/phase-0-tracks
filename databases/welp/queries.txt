You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
sqlite> Select * FROM
   ...> reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

      1|5|Best pedicure ever!|1|1|1|Corey|Walden|1|Therapie Spa
      2|1|I am going back to eating meat after this experience!|2|2|2|Neil|Barnett|2|Soul Vegetarian
      3|4|Pleasant surprise to find men clothing here|3|4|4|Maurice|Jelks|3|Kay's Things Consignment


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> Select
   ...> businesses.name as Business,
   ...> reviews.stars as Rating,
   ...> reviews.comment as Rating_Comment,
   ...> users.first_name as Reviewer
   ...> FROM
   ...> reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
sqlite> Select
   ...> businesses.name as Business,
   ...> reviews.stars as Rating,
   ...> reviews.comment as Rating_Comment,
   ...> users.first_name as Reviewer
   ...> FROM
   ...> reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> WHERE
   ...> businesses.id = 1;
