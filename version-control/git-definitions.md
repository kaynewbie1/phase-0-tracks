# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?
  * Allows you to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and also merge revisions made by different people.
* Why is it useful?
  * You can view who made what change
  * Can view what was changed
  * Can rollback to any point in time
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  * Branching creatings a copy of your project to edit.
  * You would use branching to protect the master and allows you the ability to only have to review code that was merged.
* What is a commit?
  * Git Commit saves the changes made
* What makes a good commit message?
  * Explains what feature was added or what change was made and the message is simple and easy to understand in case someone needs to understand the changes.
* What is a merge conflict?
  * Occurs when attempting to merge with the master. Is a safeguard to help bring to your attention that a conflict is in the files and you need to review and fix the issue before proceeding which helps to maintain the integrity of the master.
