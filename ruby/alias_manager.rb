Release 0: Attempt a Tricky Algorithm
In phase-0-tracks/ruby/alias_manager.rb, pseudocode and write a method that takes a spy's real name (e.g., "Felicia Torres") and creates a fake name with it by doing the following:

Swapping the first and last name.
Changing all of the vowels (a, e, i, o, or u) to the next vowel in 'aeiou', and all of the consonants (everything else besides the vowels) to the next consonant in the alphabet. So 'a' would become 'e', 'u' would become 'a', and 'd' would become 'f'.
If you get really and truly stuck, just write an alias method that loops through the original name and changes the letters somehow, without worrying about implementing this particular algorithm. It's really not worth stressing about. Simply attempting the algorithm will help you improve, even if you didn't quite get there.

This is the most complex algorithm you've had to write, and the toughest release of this challenge. How will you break it down into manageable pieces? Try to identify all of the mini-challenges and considerations that show up in your algorithm, such as
When will it be helpful to convert the string to an array to work with it more easily?
How will you figure out whether a letter is a vowel?
How will you deal with the fact that some letters are uppercase?
How will you handle edge cases?
You may find it helpful to write additional methods -- one for each job -- and then combine them. It's less overwhelming, for instance, to start converting your algorithm to code by writing a next_vowel method that takes a vowel character and returns the next vowel character. Once you know that small piece works because you've tested it with a few different vowels, you can use it in your program and trust that it's unlikely to be the source of any bugs that come up. This is a great way to make steady progress.

If you do successfully implement the algorithm, "Felicia Torres" will become "Vussit Gimodoe", which is a rather odd name. Luckily, our dearest Vussit is from a country no one has ever heard of, mainly because it doesn't really exist.

Release 1: Provide a User Interface
DO THE THING
Provide a user interface that lets a user enter a name and get a fake name back. Let the user do this repeatedly until they decide to quit by typing 'quit'. (They might just hit Enter to continue.)

Release 2: Store the Aliases
DO THE THING
Use a data structure to store the fake names as they are entered. When the user exits the program, iterate through the data structure and print all of the data the user entered. A sentence like "Vussit Gimodoe is actually Felicia Torres" or "Felicia Torres is also known as Vussit Gimodoe" for each agent is fine.
