#i am not sure if this is where it should go? I tried to put it before the last end and it printed, but it printed every timre the program started over.

=begin
Questions I have:
- Wasnt sure how to verify age and/or year so I set an age range and validated against that.
- I don't know how to check the year against the birthdate entered to verify if they match.
- I am not sure if I honored this requirement in my code above: "Your program should base its result on the latest condition matched, not the first condition matched. In other words, it's not a "only one condition will apply" sort of scenario. This may mean repeatedly updating a variable as each condition is checked, so that the variable always contains the most precise result."
