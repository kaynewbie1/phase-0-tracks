=begin
program for a designer to input interior design details for each client
input and capture interior design details by client - name, age, number of children, decor theme
keys should be symbols unless needed for formatting

Required Program Rules
- Prompt the designer/user for all of this information.
- Convert any user input to the appropriate data type.
- Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.
- Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). After all, sometimes users make mistakes! If the designer says "none", skip it. But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. (Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) You can assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.
- Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.

#the program is not reading "none" as a string so converting to a symbol and adding as a new key called :none. How do I make it read 'none' as a string so it can end and put thank you if they type none? I tried to convert to string by using the method: "none".to_s but it didn't work. I am lost on this one. Need help.

#also, why and when do I use != none vs == !("none") I am confused on this also because sometime it works and other times it don't.
